                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a web designer and avid fan of many things nerd culture, I spend my time learning how to better perform at coding and finding new and fun things to geek out over. My main focus is learning how to perform better with my code and play games. My biggest hope is to collaborate with and learn from more experienced coders and also become a larger part in designing websites. I'm always looking for new ways to learn and what I can teach myself. </p>
